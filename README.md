## Details

### GWT
We are planning to use Google Web Toolkit - Google's development toolkit for building and optimizing complex browser-based applications. It provides both high-performance web applications and productivity to the developers. GWT is used by many products at Google, including AdWords, AdSense, Flights, Hotel Finder, Offers, Wallet, Blogger. Itâ€™s open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world.

We would be using MVP framework - Model, View, Presenter framework as suggested for large scale application development. This provides two main advantages:
* Decouples development allowing multiple developers to work together
* Creation of lightweight tests
